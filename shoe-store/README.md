 👟 Shoe-Store
Shoe Store is a responsive React-based web app built using Tailwind CSS, where users can browse different shoes, add them to their cart, adjust quantities, and see the total price dynamically.

It’s a perfect mini e-commerce project to understand state management, React props, and cart functionality in a real-world setup.
